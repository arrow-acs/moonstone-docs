## MQTT Topics

The `mqttTopics` property can be set to any MQTT topic hierarchy, and it supports standard MQTT wildcards (# and +).

* `#` - Can be used for all remaining levels of hierarchy
* `+` - A wildcard for any single level of hierarchy

For example, the `mqttTopics` property can be set to `device/+/sensors/#`. The first `+` matches any one value at that level of hierarchy - for example a device ID - and `#` matches anything including and beyond that level, for example sensor types, locations, etc. That will subscribe to topics like:

* device/id-0/sensors/temperature/bedroom
* device/id-0/sensors/temperature/kitchen
* device/id-a/sensors/humidity/bedroom
* device/id-a/sensors/pressure/bedroom
