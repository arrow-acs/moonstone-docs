# properties

index=integer
# Defines index of local camera to be used for capturing

maxFrameCounter=integer
# Defines maximum number of frames in video clip

saveToFile=boolea
# Defines if clip should be saved to file

frameRate=integer
# Defines FPS of captured video

frameWidth=integer
# Defines width of captured video

frameHeight=integer
# Defines height of captured video

fourcc=string
# Defines codec to be used in captured video encoding, H264

directory=string
# Defines directory that captured clips should be saved to. Makes sense only if saveToFile=true

fileNamePattern=string%s.mp4
# Defines pattern to build file name

saveAsStream=boolean
# Defines if clip should be saved as images stream

streamNamePattern=string
# Defines pattern to build stream file name

videoLenMins=long
# Defines maximum length of captured video in minutes

liveStream=boolean
# Defines if captured images should be sent as telemetry to cloud

liveFrameWidth=integer
# Defines width of images to be sent as telemetry. Makes sense only if liveStream=true

liveFrameHeight=integer
# Defines height of images to be sent as telemetry. Makes sense only if liveStream=true

sendFrameCounter=integer
# Defines rate of sending captured images as telemetry. Makes sense only if liveStream=true

retryIntervalSecs=integer

# Defines interval between attempts of capturing in case if errors occured

detectDisconnectMs=integer
# Defines maximum time for capturing one image. Exceeding of this threshold means webcam disconnected
